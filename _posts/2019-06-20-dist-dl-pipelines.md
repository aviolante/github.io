In this notebook I use PySpark, Keras, and Elephas python libraries to build an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that runs on Spark. Spark is an open-source distributed analytics engine that can process large amounts of data with tremendous speed. PySpark is simply the python API for Spark that allows you to use an easy programming language, like python, and leverage the power of Apache Spark ...
