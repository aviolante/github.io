Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most basic and widely used dimension reduction techniques. However, I’d also say its one of the least understood from a technical standpoint and maybe seen as “black box”. I’m going to try to clearly, and in 5 minutes, explain PCA for anyone to understand. I’ll also include python code for each step, wrapped in a function, to do PCA using Scikit-learn and the manual process with Numpy. I find learning the steps through theory and code is a great holistic way to learn ...
