Naive Bayes is a set of simple and efficient machine learning algorithms for solving a variety of classification and regression problems. If you haven’t been in a stats class for a while or seeing the word “bayesian” makes you uneasy then this is may be a good 5-minute introduction. I’m going to give an explanation of Bayes theorem and then Naive Bayes within 5 minutes using a fitness gym new years resolution example. I’ll also include some simple python code using Scikit-learn in my GitHub. Let’s get started ...
